# algorithmics
A repository of my algorithmic career codes (not all working!) and some of the resources I used throughout.

The problem filenames and folders usually correspond to task shortcodes in respective contests/class/workshop. 

The repo was treated as a quick backup multiple times and sadly does not follow the git best practices, a cleanup is on the way. 
I intend to update codes with links to problem statements and tidy the commit history a bit.
